# OpenGL Graphics Project
## About
This project is a 3D Object Collision Demo developed using OpenGL as part of a university Graphics course. It simulates real-time collision detection between objects in a 3D space, applying basic physics principles like velocity, acceleration, and object interaction upon impact. The project also incorporates shaders to handle lighting and surface effects, which enhance the visual representation of the scene. By using collision algorithms like bounding volumes, this demo demonstrates how collisions are managed in 3D environments. The project provided valuable experience in both collision detection and shader programming, essential for modern graphics and game development.
## Installation

To run the **3D Object Collision Demo**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikos-pap/Lab1-Graphics.git
    ```

2. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio**:
    - Navigate to the project folder.
    - Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3. **Add Dependencies**:
    - Dependencies are located in the `dependencies` folder.
    - Detailed instructions for adding them to the project can be found in the `dependencies/README.txt` file.

4. **Build and Run**:
    - Once the dependencies are set up, build the project by selecting **Build > Build Solution**.
    - If the build succeeds, run the demo by pressing **F5** or selecting **Debug > Start Debugging**.
## Execution Instructions
![Example Image](Images/ExampleImage.png)
Once you run the demo, the program will open in the 3D scene. You can move around the scene, spawn small random shapes, and observe the collisions between the objects in real-time. Use the controls below to navigate and interact with the scene.

### Game Controls
| Action                 | Control Key    |
|------------------------|:--------------:|
| **Spawn** Random Shape | `Space`        |
| **Decrease** Speed     | `<`            |
| **Increase** Speed     | `>`            |
| **Mute** Sounds        | `M`            |
| **Exit**               | `Esc`          |

**TODO**: 

-ShapeFactory: 
	-remove 'data' as it's handled by the vao (vertex array object).

	-refactor shapeFactory so that only one vao, vbo, ebo/ibo is created per shape. As id is a reference, any other copy of the object will hold this id.
		shapeFactory must hold each shape's type and corresponding id in an unordered map. Key value is 'int shapeType' from Shape. Pair is "vao_id" from Shape.
	+fix cube indices by making them 3 times as bigger. the indices will stay the same, the 2 other times they will be shifted by 8 or 16. 
	Correct indices for front/rear are in comment in ShapeFactory.cpp. Correct for Top Bottom and Left Right will have to follow. Some maths required.
