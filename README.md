# OpenGL Graphics Project
## About
This project is a 3D Object Collision Demo developed using OpenGL as part of a university Graphics course. It simulates real-time collision detection between objects in a 3D space, applying basic physics principles like velocity, acceleration, and object interaction upon impact. The project also incorporates shaders to handle lighting and surface effects, which enhance the visual representation of the scene. By using collision algorithms like bounding volumes, this demo demonstrates how collisions are managed in 3D environments. The project provided valuable experience in both collision detection and shader programming, essential for modern graphics and game development.
